Using OFX via the net, the goal is to retrieve as much info as possible via
cli.

To use this, you will need to obtain info about your financial institution,
and plug the bits into 'ofxcli.conf' to be installed as $HOME/.ofxcli.conf.

Ultimately, this will permit repackaging the info into files for various
accounting software that may not have native OFX support, e.g. ledger.
